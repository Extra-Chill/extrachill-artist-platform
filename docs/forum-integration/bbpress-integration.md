# Forum Integration (Removed in v1.1.0)

**Note**: bbPress forum integration was completely removed in version 1.1.0. This functionality is no longer available in the plugin.

The forum integration previously provided:
- Artist-specific forum sections
- Custom permissions and linked discussions
- Forum notifications for artist members
- Forum management interfaces

This feature was removed to streamline the plugin and eliminate the bbPress dependency. Artist profiles now focus on core functionality: profiles, link pages, analytics, and subscriptions.
